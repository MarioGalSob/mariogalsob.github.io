            <p>
              This was my second big project using C/C++. This version of Asteroids was developed during my first Computing HND year and, at the time, I had only about five months worth of experience using said language. The game was coded using C/C++, ImGui and ESAT own libraries
            </p>
            <p>
              The game aimed to be as close to the original as possible while also implementing a user registration/login system using ImGui. The registration/login system was quite tricky to implement correctly but in the end it allow to save multiple users using binary files while also having an admin mode and a scoreboard with the score of all the users.
              As for the game itself, it has a game loop as close to the original as posible. Adjusting everything was kinda complicated but in the end the result was almost identical to the original version of the game.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the end, the project turned out great given that this was my second big project using C/C++ and also my first time using ImGui. 
              This was also the first time that I worked with vector graphics which was a technique difficult to grasp at the beggining, especially regarding collisions but that I end up growing to like as I worked on the project.
