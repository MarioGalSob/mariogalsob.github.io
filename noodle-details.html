            <p>
              Noodle: A Big Adventure is a game that was developed by a group of 4 programmers, 2 designers and 1 artist. It was developed using a PlayStation®5 custom-built engine on a span of 5 months.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the span of this project I worked as both a graphic and tools programmer. Starting with the graphic part, I implemented PBR (Physical Based Rendering) and normal mapping which turned out really well enhancing the look of the game.
              As for the tools aspect, I developed a fully working level editor for both designers and programmer to work with. The level editor was developed using ImGui and includes a hierarchy system that display oll elements on scene and allows to search for them.
              It also includes a menu to create new elements that were fully customizable. The level editor also includes an inspector that displays all properties of the object in scene and allows developers to update it in real time. The level editor also has an assets window
              that displays all the assets (models, textures, audios and scenes) available to be used. On top of that, assets are loaded from json file, meaning that it is possible to add and remove assets even when the game is running.
              Finally, we have scenes. Scenes are the biggest part of this level editor in m opinion since it allowed designers and programmers to iterate in different spaces and also to save them and load them back whenever they wanted. This feature was developed using RapidJson same as the assets json previously mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having the opportunity to work with PlayStation®5 was an incredible experience and it allowed to learn a lot of new things and also open new doors towards my future. I feel very satisfied with the work I did and how the project turned out.
